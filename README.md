# vebits_api
A high-level, comprehensive package that leverages user's experience when working with Tensorflow's Object Detection API.

## Overview
This package has been developed to turn my works at [Vebits](https://vebits.com/en) into a friendly, easy-to-use API that facilitate user's experience when working with [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection). New features are being developed and tested to working with [DarkNet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet)/[Darkflow](https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow) for training YOLO models running real-time on mobile devices.

## Installation
To install the latest stable release of this package, simply run:
```
pip install vebits_api
```
Alternatively, to build the project from source in development mode and allow the changes to take effect immediately:
```
git clone https://github.com/hnt4499/vebits_api/
cd vebits_api/
pip install -e .
```
That's it! To make use of available scripts for data manipulating/processing/visuali

## TODO:
